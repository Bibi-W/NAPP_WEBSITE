
This is the branch that I (Bianca) am working on; the Cheatsheet and Data Entry are
outdated.

To find the page with the search result cards, go to "Search" on the main page - this
is just a temporary measure, it'll need to be integrated as the output for actually
performing a search. Also, I'm going to move the search bar into its own html file
now that I know how to import those (this has been attempted in nav.html, but that's
extremely outdated).

The files for the results page are search.html, search.css, and search.js.
The template for a blank result card is found in searchcard.html.

Apologies for the mess; it's taking some time to learn how to apply the techniques I
would use to simplify C++ or Python in these languages. Also, some of the pages may take
a bit to update (the link to the search results page works though).
