
This is the branch that I (Bianca) am working on; I've done some merging with the previous
Github version, but some parts of the site may be oudated.

First things first, fonts.zip needs to be unzipped to properly view the search results
page. It has a library of Bootstrap icons that's too large to upload uncompressed (there
are a great deal that we'll be able to remove in the future).

To view the search results page, go to "Search" on the main page - this is just a
temporary measure, it'll need to be integrated as the output for actually performing a
search. Also, I'm going to move the search bar into its own html file now that I know
how to import those (this has been attempted in nav.html, but that's extremely outdated).

The files for the results page are search.html, search.css, and search.js.
The template for a blank result card is found in searchcard.html.

Apologies for the mess; it's taking some time to learn how to apply the techniques I
would use to simplify C++ or Python in these languages. Also, some of the pages may take
a bit to update (the link to the search results page works though).
